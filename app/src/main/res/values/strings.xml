        \nI have asked two people to review my business plan.
        \nI have assembled my business plan in the correct order.

        \tGather all the necessary information and conduct all the research you will need to write
        an accurate and complete business plan. Use free SBA tools to aid your research.
        \nPrepare a draft business plan. Doing it is the only way you will learn. It doesn\'t have to
        be perfect, long or complete. Prepare the parts of the plan that you can.
        \nDiscuss your draft plan and any questions you have with a business mentor, coach, academic
        advisor, SBA representative or another seasoned business advisor.
        \nUse the information you receive to prepare a more finished product. Remember, the
        business plan is a living document. It is a work in progress. Refine it, improve it and use
        it as the blueprint to your success.</string>

        \n\nYou wouldn\'t drive 2,000 miles without a map,
        so don\'t start a business without writing a business plan; it\'s your roadmap to success!
        \n\nAs explained in the course, business planning helps to ensure business success. And, as the
        blueprint for your business, a business plan is a critical element because it showcases your
        business\'s vision, product/service, marketing strategies, and financial projections.
        \n\nRemember, a business plan outlines the complete operating framework of your business by
        detailing who you are, why you\'re in business, what you do, how you do it, where you operate,
        how you will generate profits, who your customers are, and why your business is important.
        \n\nThe checklist below covers information you learned in the course and organizes the checkpoints
        based on the sections of the business plan as well as what is outlined in the Build Your Business
        Plan tool. Use the checklist to measure where you are in the process of collecting the necessary
        material. As you progress, refer to the Build Your Business Plan tool for additional business plan
        writing support as needed.
        \n\nLet\'s begin charting your path to writing your business plan!</string>

    <string name="omeletRecipeSteps">*Read all instructions before you start!
        Whisk the eggs: In a small bowl, crack the eggs.
        With a fork, whisk vigorously together with the kosher salt, pepper and water.
        \nMelt the butter: Heat a small 8-inch or 10-inch
        nonstick skillet over just below high heat,
        with the pan handle facing towards you.
        Add the butter and swirl the pan to fully coat.
        Wait until the butter starts to become foamy
        with large bubbles but not yet browned, then pour in eggs.
        \nCook the omelette (0 to 15 seconds):
        When a skin just starts to form after 10 to 15 seconds,
        add the cheese (and other filling ingredients)
        in a line from left to right. Working quickly,
        run a small spatula under the far edge of the omelette
        to release it from the pan. Start to pull the eggs up
        and shake and tilt the pan to spread out any uncooked egg
        and allow it to cook. Using the spatula, roll the eggs up
        and over the cheese; this will be intentionally messy!
        \nCook the omelette (15 to 30 seconds):
        Cook another 10 to 15 seconds until just barely set;
        the outside should be a pale golden and the inside soft and creamy.
        For a harder cooked omelette, cook several seconds longer. Turn off the heat.
        \nFlip the omelette onto a plate: To remove the omelette,
        hold a plate in one hand. Then pick up the pan with your right hand,
        thumb up, and quickly turn the pan upside down over the plate
        so that the omelette rolls off onto the middle of the plate,
        folding over itself into a rolled shape. Serve immediately.</string>
    <string name="omeletRecipeNote">Ingredients\n- 2 eggs\n- ⅛ teaspoon kosher salt
        \n- 2 grinds fresh ground black pepper
        \n- ½ teaspoon water\n- ½ tablespoon butter\n- ¼ cup shredded cheese,
        ideally 2 tablespoons each shredded cheddar and Parmesan
        \n- Additional filling ingredients, if desired (see source)

    <string name="porridgeRecipeSteps">Put 50g porridge oats in a saucepan,
        pour in 350ml milk or water and sprinkle in a pinch of salt.
        Bring to the boil and simmer for 4-5 minutes,
        stirring from time to time and watching carefully
        that it doesn\'t stick to the bottom of the pan.
        \nOr you can try this in a microwave. Mix the porridge oats,
        milk or water and a pinch of salt in a large microwave-proof bowl,
        then microwave on High for 5 minutes, stirring halfway through.
        Leave to stand for 2 minutes before eating.
        \nTo serve, pour into bowls, spoon Greek yogurt,
        thinned with a little milk, on top and drizzle with honey.</string>

    <string name="remindersListItems">Just relax &amp; do what you think is best;
        don\'t dwell on mistakes, you will learn as you go.
        \nKnow that you have the power to figure things out &amp;
        that success is within your reach.
        \nYou are more likely to succeed
        if you put all your energy in finding practical solutions.
        The less you worry, the better the result will be.
        \nAlways keep trying like you would in a game; when you lose,
        you want to keep trying until you win.
        \nBelieve everything happens for a reason and
        there is a specific path being paved for you.
        \nMotivate yourself to start something by imagining
        the feeling of accomplishment you\'ll get when completing it.
        \nSometimes bad things happen, but there\'s always more good things;
        we just easily take them for granted.
        \nReward yourself when you finish something
        as a reminder that you are capable.
        Acknowledge your accomplishments &amp;
        focus on what you\'re proud of.</string>
